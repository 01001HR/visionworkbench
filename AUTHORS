The Vision Workbench was developed within the Autonomous Systems and 
Robotics area of the Inteligent Systems Division at NASA's Ames 
Research Center.  It is predominantly a joint venture of the 
Intelligent Robotics Group (IRG) and the Adaptive Control and 
Evolvable Systems Group (ACES) at Ames.
