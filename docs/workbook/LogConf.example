# This is an example VW log configuration file. Save 
# this file to ~/.vw_logconf to adjust the VW log 
# settings, even if the program is already running.
#
# The following integers are associated with the 
# log levels throughout the Vision Workbench.  Use 
# these in the log rules below. 
#
#    ErrorMessage = 0
#    WarningMessage = 10
#    InfoMessage = 20
#    DebugMessage = 30
#    VerboseDebugMessage = 40
#
# You can create a new log file or adjust the settings 
# for the console log:
#
#   logfile <filename> 
#       - or -
#   logfile console
#
# Once you have created a logfile (or selected the 
# console), you can add log rules using the following 
# syntax. (Note that you can use wildcard characters 
# '*' to catch all log_levels for a given log_namespace, 
# or vice versa.)
#
# <log_level> <log_namespace>
#
# Example: For the console log, turn on InfoMessage 
# logging for the thread sub-system and log every 
# message from the cache sub-system.

logfile console
20 thread
* cache


# Turn on DebugMessage logging for both subsystems  
# to a file on disk.
