\chapter{Introduction}

This document is designed to be a gentle introduction to programming
with the NASA Vision Workbench, a C++ image processing and machine
vision library.

The Vision Workbench was developed through a joint
project of the Intelligent Robotics Group (IRG) and the Adaptive
Control and Evolvable Systems Group (ACES) within the Intelligent
Systems Division at NASA's Ames Research Center.
